        content = "<u>OVERVIEW</u><br><br>EnviroHypno is a tool that lets users redefine their relationship with technology through the use of sound and the act of field recording, while also grounding oneself in their immediate physical surroundings with ‘self-inflicted hypnosis.’ How does this web tool do that? EnviroHypno asks the users to record short audio clips to create auditory art through the manipulation/control of their external environment -- rather than through the digital interface. In this way, the tool 'inverts’ the recording/production of sound by redefining technology's place in the creative process. Overall, we are using our physical space to control the stagnant technologies -- instead of vice-versa. The objective of this piece is to ultimately gain a sense of curiosity about the alternative ways in which we can incorporate technologies into our lives.<br><br>The tool has simple UI/UX as it is meant to be used by anyone regardless of their technical/musical abilities. With this web application, users will be able to:<br><br>1. Make short field recordings (approximately 5-10 seconds).<br>2. Listen to their most recent sound creation- the sound creation amounts from pressing a ‘mix’ button that takes their field recordings, and algorithmically-distorts it into hypnotic music.<br>3. Engage in surrealist sound activities.<br>4. Keep a sound journal.<br><br>Thus far, a demo of the web tool can be found at <a href='https://altrs.github.io/envirohypno/'>https://altrs.github.io/envirohypno/</a>.<br><br><br><u>CONCEPT + INSPIRATION</u><br><br>A main inspiration for this experimental sound experience is the article, “Soundwalking and the Bodily Exploration of Places” by David Paquette and Andra McCartney. The article questions the role of the participants, their agency, as well as the incorporation of improvisation. EnviroHypno attempts to incorporate all of these elements into the experience, ensuring that the user is in control of the sound outcome. Overall, this piece relies on user decision and their physical space to control the technology’s output-- instead of vice-versa.<br><br>As stated previously, I wanted to create something simple, making EnviroHypno accessible and easy-to-use by anyone, regardless of their technical abilities. Rather than having the user utilize lots of control buttons to create the sound they desire, I want the users to ‘control’ the sound through their physical space. For example, rather than a user editing the pitch of a sample by adjusting a dial, I want this project to push them to go out into their world and listen for a pitch they like, then record it as-is. EnviroHypno is ultimately a simple auditory ‘iSpy’ game that results in your own personal hypnosis track.<br><br>The theme of the piece is a coagulation between technogaianism, luddism and solar-punk mentalities. I looked to Annie Levin, Design Justice Principles, Alice Yuan Zhang, Community Tech NY and others in order to guide the project’s message. EnviroHypno asks the user to cultivate a sense of curiosity for their physical environment, rethink their relationship with technology, and take control of both. Ultimately, I believe that EnviroHypno is a qualitative contribution to the redefining of our relationship with technology and control.<br><br><br><u>PROJECT DIRECTION</u><br><br>While the main functionality has been mocked-up on the demo page, I would like to use your open-call as an opportunity to build upon it, specifically focusing on:<br><br>1. Researching the properties/attributes of hypnotic music and how hypnotic tracks can be created algorithmically with field recordings (regardless of the actual recordings’ content). And further, exploring at a deeper level how self-inflicted hypnosis can be related back to our relationship with technology and space.<br>2. Pushing the boundaries of accessible and intuitive UI/UX, possibly creating a more spatial, intuitive, and experimental interface –a.k.a. creating a cohesive labyrinth for digital sound creation. A main inspiration for this directive is the article, <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-kjCk68D6LlS7qtZ7xwO5NBlaMGEsij/view'>‘This is Not my Beautiful House: Examining the Desktop Metaphor, 1980-1995’</a> by Everest Pipkin.<br>3. Creating a section on the web page that gives users ideas for sound creation, based on <a href='https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Brotchie_Alastair_Gooding_Mel_eds_A_Book_of_Surrealist_Games_1995.pdf'>‘A Book of Surrealist Games.’</a> As of right now, the demo has a random ‘sound recipe generator.’ But I believe by pushing this type of interactivity further, this tool can become highly engaging, letting users tap into their inner child, playing auditory iSpy/scavenger hunt games.<br>4. One other direction for this project could be creating a digital community around this tool. One way I was thinking of doing this is by building a ‘forum’ on the webpage for individuals to share things from their sound journal, talk to others about sound, space, technology, algorithmic sound programming etc.";

        title = "TECH DESCRIPTION ☞ ENVIROHYPNO";
        content = "Exploring the technical aspects of the piece: the website will have the following aspects:<br><br>1. The interface of the sound-art tool itself. This tool entails using an API such as MediaRecorder to record the user’s samples on first button press. On second button press, the recorder stops and saves the recording, adding it to an array. The user can do this as many times as they like. The mix button that takes all recorded samples and algorithmically distorts it to create a hypnotic audio piece (more on this in #2). And lastly, a clear button that gets rid of all the recorded samples. Within the demo, I also included a slider that simply controls the rate in which the mixed audio is played back (subject to change or be removed).<br>2. For the audio manipulation, I will most likely be using Tone.js to mix the recorded samples and create the hypnotic sound output; however, another possibility could be using Sonic Pi, or another equivalent. Within the demo, the main effects I used include: reverb, Tone.js’s distortion effect, and a feedback delay. I also utilized an equalizer and adjusted the attack, release and duration with randomized values. A large inspiration for the auditory quality of my piece was Toshimaru Nakamura’s ‘No-Input Mixing Board’ album for its trance-like feeling; however, this is the main technical aspect that I would like to work on and develop further, after doing some research regarding what makes hypnotic music, truly hypnotic.<br>3. For the surrealist sound activities, I plan to have auditory descriptions of the games (and possibly diagrams), in an experimental library/shelf-style format, utilizing randomization and possibly unorthodox use of screen space.<br>4. The sound journal will involve either local storage, or connecting the webpage to a database that allows users to create ‘accounts.’ There will be space for the user to write notes, and possibly draw mind-maps, or save recordings of spoken notes.<br>5. Furthermore, connecting this page to a database and creating a community sharing-platform is another option for this project. This could allow users to interact with each other, post sound recipes for others to see, create a collaborative sound piece (possibly a culmination of shared sound art), etc.<br>6. The visuals currently on the demo have been created by importing Blender files into Osci-Render, and then refining them in Premiere Pro. For this project, I would be open to redesigning them, creating generative audio-visuals that respond to the created audio art, rather than stagnant gifs.<br><br>As a final note, while I look forward to creating an experimental web interface, I would also like to ensure that this web page is accessible – thus it may be imperative to create a ‘no-frills’ version of each page, that is more straightforward and familiar for users.";
